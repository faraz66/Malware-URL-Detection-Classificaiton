# Malware URL Detection and Classification (Severity-based)

This project focuses on detecting and classifying URLs using machine learning models, with a special emphasis on classifying malware into severity levels. By leveraging key lexical features extracted from URLs, this project categorizes them into benign, malware, phishing, and more. The dataset used is from Phishtank, a well-known source for phishing URLs.

# Introduction
The detection of malicious URLs is crucial in preventing phishing attacks, malware downloads, and unauthorized website modifications. This project uses machine learning to classify URLs based on their threat level, including categorizing malware into severity levels (low, medium, high). The primary objective is to enhance cybersecurity by enabling real-time URL classification.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Phishtank, which provides verified phishing URLs. The dataset is enriched with additional lexical and host-based features, allowing us to classify URLs into categories such as:

Benign: Safe URLs.
Phishing: URLs attempting to steal sensitive information.
Malware: Further classified based on severity levels (low, medium, high).

# Features
We extract several key features from the URLs to help classify them, including:

URL length
    Number of subdomains and special characters
    Presence of keywords like "login", "secure", or "bank"
    Use of IP addresses in place of domains
    Severity Classification: Based on URL characteristics, malware is classified into three severity levels: low, medium, and high.

# Machine Learning Models
 We explored various machine learning models, such as:
 
  1. Random Forest
  
  2. Support Vector Machines
  
  3. Decision Trees
  
Note : Random Forest was found to be the most effective, especially in classifying malware into different severity levels. We applied cross-validation and grid search to fine-tune the model.

# Results

The classification achieved impressive performance:

Accuracy: 96%

Precision: 98% for malware classification

Recall: 95% for severity levels
